| .github/workflows | This contains the main.yml file needed to kick off the task of updated the weblog whenever this repo is changed.                               |
| Images            | Occasionally posts with need hosted images instead of something from Unsplash. In those rare situations, they are hosted here.                 |
| Weblog            | This is where all of the files that [weblog.lol](https://weblog.lol) can actually see reside, within subfolders listed below.                  |
| .../Configuration | These configuration files are required for [weblog.lol](https://weblog.lol), and feature the main template and a config file.                  |
| .../Pages         | Any page that isn't a blog post belongs in here, they tend to also require their own template.                                                 |
| .../Posts         | This folder contains the Markdown files for each blog post, they are sub-divided into `Year/Month`. Files start `xx -` with `xx` being the day.|
| .../Templates     | Though the main template is housed in `/Configuration`, the secondary templates for non-post pages are hosted within this folder.              |
