# The Reason #1: The Beginning.
My mental health has been a bit of a mess recently. More so than usual, and that's saying something! As such, I thought it may be fun to do a little exercise.

I haven't committed to living forever, hell, I haven't even committed to living for the next 20 years. That's fine because sometimes it's about committing to tomorrow, or even just today. Every day, I try to find my "reason". The reason I want to be around tomorrow. 

Sometimes, it's something massive: It's because I'm going to Miami to watch Formula 1 with my dad and the 2 weeks away will be incredible! (this is from last year)

Other times (hell, most of the times), it's something tiny: I had a Tropical Twist-flavoured Fanta, and you know what? I could do that again sometime.

However big or small, over the next 30-ish days, I want to take a little bit of time talking about that reason. Think of this like a public journal. If it gets to 10pm-ish and you think to yourself "wait a second, George hasn't posted a reason today", please feel free to shout at me either on [the bird app](https://snpy.tech/twitter) or [Mastodon](https://snpy.tech/mastodon). Chances are, I just completely forgot.

## Today's Reason: I made Oreos electronically conductive.
A few months ago, I [made a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg4Ihfs1uMo) where I used Krispy Kreme doughnuts to play Forza Horizon 5 as part of an Xbox collaboration. More recently, Xbox has partnered with Oreo for limited edition cookies and I wanted to do a similar thing with new food. The only issue? Oreos aren't electronically conductive! I set up some tests, and the Oreos wouldn't work as buttons.

I took inspiration from their tagline "Milk's Favorite Cookie", and dunked an Oreo into some milk. The damp biscuit worked! Now to figure out what game I can actually play on up to 12 cookies, and to make a video...
