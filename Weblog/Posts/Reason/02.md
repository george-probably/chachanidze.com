# The Reason #2: TV Shows
It's a Friday, and I have not one, but TWO shows that are currently airing on Fridays that I am keeping track of.

## BattleBots
Last night, BattleBots aired in the US, and I watched it... very legally. The episode marks the halfway point of the season, and I want to see who can pull out the major W. Personally, I'm hoping Witch Doctor comes away with the [giant nut](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/tv6chd/season_six_winner_holding_the_giant_nut/) (heh).

I'm not saying there was a lot of drama in this episode, but [the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/) is kind of outraged right now ðŸ˜¬

Robot Wars was a massive part of my childhood, and though I have never built a combat robot, it has always been something I have wanted to do. Excuses nowadays are running a bit thin. Hell, I'm only 13 miles away from [Bristol Bot Builders](https://bristolbotbuilders.com/)! I should give them a visit...

## Beyond Paradise
A spin-off of Death in Paradise, Beyond Paradise has been... Interesting.

We've hit the halfway point of this season too, but something about it feels off. I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe it's just first-season quirkiness, but something about it means I'm not as hooked. I wouldn't go as far as to say that I haven't been enjoying it, but it's also not quite standing up to the quality of the original show. It's only a six-episode season though, so I'll be seeing where it ends up.

### Side note: I just realised that neither of these shows is airing next week. BattleBots because of March Madness, and Beyond Paradise because of Red Nose Day.
