## Reason #6: The (lack of) Numbers
There's no denying that [Weblog.lol](https://weblog.lol) is a small service. It's made entirely possible by one guy (who I am lucky enough to consider a friend), and calling the service bare-bones *feels* mean, but is undeniably the reason I love it so much. The simplicity is what makes it such a joy to use - and part of that simplicity is a complete lack of built-in analytics.

Most people would see that as a negative with a "but George, I want to know how many views I'm getting and whether or not I should monetize my blog", however, you're wrong. This blog may be getting 0 views, or it may be the reason [Adam](https://social.lol/@adam) has been getting DDOS'd so much recently (maybe the entirety of China just **really** wants to read my blog).

Not knowing is actually really nice. Not worrying about maximising my CTR, or whether or not the SEO is perfect. Sure there are some posts that I want to do well, and honestly, I'll probably end up putting those across something like Medium too, but 99% of the writing I do is more for me than anyone else. If others happen to be along for the ride and enjoying it, that's great too!

Also: Happy Pi day!
