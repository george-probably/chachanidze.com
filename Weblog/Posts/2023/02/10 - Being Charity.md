# Being.Charity - a list of charities to help you be better at being

This week, I bought a new domain. Specifically: [being.charity](https://being.charity).

## What is it?
[**Being Charity**](https://being.charity) is a list of health charities (both physical and mental) dedicated to prolonging how long you are here, whether supporting mental health or researching physical health conditions to improve quality of life.

As with anything I make, this is a WIP and I hope to build out the list over the coming days and weeks. 

I bought the domain at 1 am and threw the site together in a couple of hours. I want to make a proper directory of charities, but needed a couple to start with, so here we are.


## Why?
As someone who often struggles with my own mental health, highlighting charities that do such critical work is super important to me.

There's a reason the footer of this blog (and [**Being Charity**](https://being.charity)) is "kindness binds us".

The general reaction I've gotten from friends is to the effect of "that's a very you thing".

> [**Being Charity**](https://being.charity) is NOT a charity in-and-of itself. I do not accept any money for it, it is just a list of charities that I believe are doing good work.
