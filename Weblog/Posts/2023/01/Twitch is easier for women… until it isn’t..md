Three serious posts in, this might be the one that actually gets me straight-up cancelled, right here right now. That being said - this post is just a culmination of conversations I've had with loads of streamers, big and small, over the last few years. It's a sobering look at some of the trends that show the psyche of the average Twitch viewer.

## The Internet is down bad
This is text that will be the paragraph.

The proliferation of OnlyFans & Fansly... To be clear: I believe that this is work in the same way as any other content creator, and they should be respected as such...

Women are more likely to get explosive growth as men vie for attention. Donating is a way to get recognition, and they feel it could lead to a relationship.

When Amouranth came out and shared that she had a husband who had been abusive, there were men who felt she had "lied to them" for not telling them that she wasn't available and for "leading them on"

This exponential growth also means that the bell curve is exaggerated

## Bros just hanging out
This is text that will be the paragraph.
On the other hand, men don't get the same kind of attention
