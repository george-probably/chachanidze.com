## Twitch is easier for women… until it isn’t.

That said, this post is just a culmination of conversations I've had with many big and small streamers over the last few years. It's a sobering look at some trends that show the psyche of the average Twitch viewer. 

### The Internet is down bad

The proliferation of OnlyFans & Fansly... To be clear: I believe that this is work in the same way as any other content creator, and they should be respected as such...

Women are more likely to get explosive growth as men vie for attention. Donating is a way to get recognition, and they feel it could lead to a relationship.

![A tweet from @KEEMSTAR which reads: "Clearly husband is abusing. She showed the text. But Amouranth herself has scammed so many guys online claiming she was single for years. These twitch streamers dont care about their viewers. They all just use you & your low IQs to fill their pockets."](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FfNa8R_UcAAmvPx?format=png)<div class="caption">Tweet image taken from [@JakeSucky](https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1581709055726231555), the original tweet has been deleted.</div>

When Amouranth came out and shared that she had a husband who had been abusive, there were men who felt she had "lied to them" for not telling them that she wasn't available and for "leading them on"

This exponential growth also means that the bell curve is exaggerated

### Bros just hanging out

On the other hand, men don't get the same kind of attention. Their growth is a lot slower, but that also means that it's more sustainable. Why? Because their audience tends to be other guys who just want to hang out.
