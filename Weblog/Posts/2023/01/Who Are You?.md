# Who Are You?

What makes you who you are? Is it your actions? Those change day to day, or even moment by moment. Your reaction to something right now may have been completely different had it happened 10 minutes ago, when you had just woken up, or after a tough day at work.

Is it your memories? Surely that's terrify for someone with dementia. And what about what you had for breakfast last week? If you can't remember it, does that mean someone else decided on what to have? Does that mean someone else ate it?

OK, so maybe it's the stuff that physically makes up your body. Well, it can't be that every single cell in your body is recycled after about a year. Sure, that excludes neurones and cardiomyocyte cells, but a large majority of you will be unrecognisable on a cellular level.

Ever since secondary school, I've suffered with imposter syndrome. Now, if you don't know who that is, it basically means that I have a persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud. Someone who secretly knows nothing and is simply being deceiving all of those around me.

I'm aware of why it happens. Something known as the Dunning-kruger Effect. Put simply, it shows that after a certain point, the more you know, the less you think you know. It feels like you're being dragged under a rough tide because although you're learning as fast as you can, you know there is so much more to learn than you had previously realised.
However, simply knowing what causes your distress does not make your distress go away. My imposter syndrome significantly affects me to this day. I'm afraid of completing projects out of fear of it being seen as inadequate. I am constantly afraid that someone will look at me one day and realise that all of my success has been due to sheer luck.

My most viewed video on YouTube isn't popular because it's an amazing piece of content. It's popular because my friend was willing to talk about a pair of headphones he'd recently bought and roughly 60,000 people were interested in video making is my escape. When I make a video, I make it for me. I express who I am as best I can because I know what I enjoy.
I know I love public speaking and recording, not only technology, but myself and my interactions with the people around me. Maybe the reason the camera is such a great therapist is because it never looks back at you judging. It sees you, but is never disappointed. People are unpredictable. There's no way of knowing how they will react to a certain piece of information, but a camera that is always the same.

So maybe who you are isn't physical and isn't live right now. Maybe who you are is the impact you leave behind, the people you influence and the friends you make. So be kind because strangers are just friends you haven't met yet. And because of the first thing they'll want to ask is the question you should constantly be asking yourself.
Who are you.
