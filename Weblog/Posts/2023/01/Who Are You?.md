# Who Are You?
> Note: What you are about to read is a refined version of a talk I gave back in 2018. If you'd rather just watch the video, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVouskqKwo) or see the embed at the bottom of this page.

What makes you who you are? Is it your actions? Those change day to day or even moment by moment. Your reaction to something may have been entirely different had it happened 10 minutes ago, when you had just woken up, or after a tough day at work.

Is it your memories? That must be terrifying for someone with dementia. And what about what you had for breakfast last week? If you can't remember it, does that mean someone else decided what to have? Does that mean someone else ate it?

OK, so maybe it's the stuff that physically makes up your body. Well, it can't be that. Your body recycles every single cell after about a year. Sure, that excludes neurons and cardiomyocyte cells, but a large majority of you will be unrecognisable on a cellular level.

Ever since secondary school, I've suffered from imposter syndrome. If you don't know who that is, I have a persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud—someone who secretly knows nothing and is simply deceiving all of those around me.

I'm aware of why it happens—the Dunning-Kruger Effect. It shows that after a certain point, the more you know, the less you think you know. It feels like you're being dragged under a rough tide because although you're learning as fast as you can, you know there is much more to learn than you had previously realised.

However, knowing what causes your distress does not make your distress go away. My imposter syndrome significantly affects me to this day. I'm afraid of completing projects out of fear of them people seeing them as inadequate. I am constantly scared that someone will look at me one day and realise that all of my success has been due to sheer luck.

My most viewed video on YouTube isn't popular because it's a fantastic piece of content. It's popular because my friend was willing to talk about a pair of headphones he'd recently bought, and roughly 60,000 people were interested in video making as my escape. When I make a video, I make it for myself and express who I am as best I can because I know what I enjoy.

I love public speaking and recording, technology, myself, and my interactions with the people around me. The camera is such a great therapist because it never looks back at you judging, and it sees you but is never disappointed. People are unpredictable, and there's no way of knowing how they will react to a particular piece of information but a camera that is always the same.

So maybe who you are isn't physical and isn't live right now. Maybe who you are is the impact you leave behind, the people you influence and the friends you make. So be kind because strangers are just friends you haven't met yet. And because the first thing they'll want to ask is the question you should constantly ask yourself.

Who are you?
