# I shave my wrist, and it's not the reason you think

I recently got a brand new tattoo on my right arm, for which I needed to get a portion of my arm shaved. I've been proudly sharing pictures of the tattoo, and one question I haven't yet received is, "George, why is your wrist also shaved?"

I wear a smartwatch on my right wrist (currently the Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro 3), and I, as someone with hairy arms, always shave the part directly underneath the watch. 

To some of you, that may make complete sense; you're probably thinking, "well, duh, those heart rate sensors and pulse oximeters perform way better when they don't have to work through hair", and though that may be true, that's NOT the reason I do it. The actual reason is a lot moreâ€¦ odd.

I like my phone to be a completely silent and motionless slab; my phone doesn't so much as vibrate if I start getting a phone call. So how do I get my notifications? Exclusively via my watch. This has the knock-on effect that if I don't want to be bothered by notifications, all I have to do is take off my watch for a little bit.

Weirdly, that one analogue step feels empowering. I am physically removing the ability for people to ping me, and the shaved spot on my wrist is a reminder that I'm temporarily freeing myself from those responsibilities.

Though, that isn't 100% true. If specific people message me persistently enough (or the message contains words like "urgent" or "help"), it will force my phone to ring as the assumption is made that the message is way more important than the game of Rocket League I'm trying to win.
